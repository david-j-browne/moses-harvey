Our Newfoundland letter December 30? 1876

In our former letter I referred to a visit with which we were favoured last summer by WG Patterson Esq of the Montréal board of trade period I had just finished the perusal of his brief notes on Newfoundland; and I earnestly hope this admirable pamphlet will receive a wide circulation in Canada, especially in commercial circles, for I am not acquainted with any production which can be compared with it, in regard to the accuracy and fullness of that information regarding the resources, industries and prospects of this country period Mr Paterson has turned his visit to excellent account, and has done us a great public service by aiding in dispelling the ignorance which still prevails so widely regarding this island period no one can be better fitted for such attacks than Mr Paterson and the statements of the secretary of the Montréal board of trade will carry weight with them wherever they are red period in a compact form the pamphlet supplies a body of very valuable information, drowned from the most reliable sources period I have gone carefully through it, and I believe every statement it contains may be thoroughly relied on period if facts and figures cannot overcome the rooted incredulity which prevails in the neighbouring provinces regarding the possibility of any good thing coming out of Newfoundland, Mr Paterson's Rieff notes are to produce a good effect period I trust your commercial men will ponder carefully his representations regarding the extension of trade between this colony and the Dominion period there can be little doubt that every year will witness an increase of our commercial connections with Canada, and it is only necessary to direct the attention of the able businessmen of the Dominion to the increasing openings for trade prosecuted here, to ensure the direction of the enterprise in this direction period the more intercourse founded on mood jewel benefit is promoted the more speedily and certainly will knew from land be brought to see that her best interest will be promoted by throwing her fortunes with the Dominion period multiply? This,? Our island to the continent by a railroad and steam theory and union will follow as a matter of course period the interests of our working classes lie altogether in the direction of Confederation, little as at present, the pre-season period were we united with Canada, agricultural produce of all kinds and Canadian Manufacturer's would be admitted free of duty, thus greatly cheapening the expense of living, and at the same time opening an immense field for a Canadian products and manufacturers period we must, however, patiently await the development of the events and the fermentation of ideas in the public mind period political passion, Merrill prejudiced and self interest may prevail for a time, but the right will win period meantime I would urge all Canadians to read Mr Paterson's little pamphlet college by Lovell and company if they wish to know what is the present condition of this colony period the writer throws out some suggestive hints, which I trust our legislators will lay to heart, about the frightful destruction going on in our for instance and the utter absence of any proper regulations regarding the cutting of timber period it is to be hoped our legislators will see the necessity of revisiting existing laws, and throwing open our fine pine forest to the lumber under such restrictions as now found to work so well in Canada period it is disgraceful to us as a people that matters should be allowed to continue as they are for a single day-Art Timber allowed to write or to be destroyed by fire, and squatters unlawfully cutting down and carrying off our finest pines, in the most wasteful and injurious fashion, and contributing nothing to the revenue period by the way, why should not some of the wealthy capitalist of Canada investment in our mines period every year proves more and more the immense extent of our mineral treasures period we want capital to develop these resources period two of the wealthiest capitalist of Glascow took the bets cold mine, with Mr ElEllerhausen as managing Partner, about two years ago period this year Mr is Dixckson and McKenzie will probably packet each £30,000 currency as they are sure other profits of this mine period

The railway

Another gentle man who has rendered good service to this colony is Mr Stanford Fleming period he was the first to point out the importance of a railway across the island, from St John's to St Georges day, as a means of shortening the route between the two continents; and he used his influence in favour of the North Shore wrote, by which the integer colonial railway has been brought, at Chaleur, to the point nearest Newfoundland, ready at any future time for connection with our Island railway period not only soul, but Mr Fleming has superintended the preliminary survey of our railway, free of charge, and secured for us a most satisfactory performance of the work, and he is indefatigable in promoting the project by every means in his power period before 10 years elapse I venture to predict we shall have this railway; and with it a great and prosperous future awaits this one is unknown and despised island period

New geography of Newfoundland

I venture to call attention to oil geography of Newfoundland just published by GF Howley Esq assistant geological survey period it is an excellent compare and, giving fall and accurate information regarding the topography, geology, climate, natural productions, economics, et cetera of the island period Mr Howley has executed his cash in a most credible manner period one good feature in the little volume is a list of indigenous animals of the island, about which so little is known period the area of the lakes already surveyed is also given and the height et cetera of the principal mountains period aided by this and Mr Paterson's pamphlet of very fear knowledge of this country might be acquired period the GR graffiti paint a small map of the island period the price is only 40% period orders can be sent to our principal booksellers here-Mr T Mccomman or Mr. O.f. Chisholm period the book is published by the Stanford, London period

More copper or

A new discovery of a deposit of copper or is announced at Harbour Main and Hollywood at the head of conception day period it is said that some Nova Scotia and capitalist have entered into an arrangement for the working of this mind period it is to be noted that this new discovery is not in the region where our present minds are-proving that mineral bearing rocks are very widely distributed period

New? Of heroism

The readers of the Gazette may remember an account I gave in November of last year of the rescue of 12 men from the ship of the wider watch at Pooch cold period? The heroic efforts of Alfred? Fishermen and a number of his? Period in the darkness of a winter? And in the midst of a snowstorm, Alfred, permitted himself to be swung? Question of a rope over precipice 600 feet? At the bottom of which worked well ship wrecked men, clinging to our rock, with the sea washing over them period more reach them with a rope and one by one all were drawn up and saved period are late Gov, Sir S Hill forwarded statement of the gallant question mark of more and his companions to the Imperial authorities and the result was that the Royal Humane Society have sent out a silver medal for Moors and our bronze medallion for each of his companions period Lady Glover very kindly presented the medal's a few days ago to the brave men? Especially called for the purpose in the colonial building period this graceful and kindly act on the part of her ladyship has been very fully appreciated and worthily in our girl raided her residence in the colony over whose? Her husband presides period

Disasters at sea

We have had some heavy gales of late, resulting in considerable loss of life and property period the barque di the Chipman, laden with copper or, from debts cold for Swansea, where do sure at witless Bay and became a tall wreck period no lives were lost period the kitty Clyde, old by Rogerson &, was last in day of Ireland's-all and is saved period several coasting craft, which left before the severe deal of the 17th and 18th were not yet accounted for period the rescue of the crew of the Daniel a Burn ham by the? Steamer Austrian is one of the most remarkable on record period I? The account published in the Newfoundlander: one of the most miraculous escapes of which we have any record is that of the crew of the American schooner Daniel a Burn ham period business Salt was lying off Sable Island when, on Sunday evening the 10th instant, she was struck by a heavy sea which completely turned her over period she, however, speedily came up on the other side, her mass having given away and the recovery was no doubt that are only assisted by the balance being secured in the barn by a strong platform, which kept it well in its place period but the remarkable part of the story is, that though the vessel was bus rolled over upon the other side, not a life of the crew of 13 men was last period all but one were below with the time, and they were no doubt saved by the extreme rapidity of the movement, which left not time enough for the vessel to steal period they were precipitated from the floor to the deck when she was bottom up, and speedily again to the floor when she righted period on
