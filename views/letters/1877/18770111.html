  <h1>January 11, 1877</h1>
  <p>Our Newfoundland letter December 30? 1876</p>
  <p>In our former letter I referred to a visit with which we
    were <span class=SpellE>favoured</span> last summer by WG Patterson <span
class=SpellE>Esq</span> of the Montréal board of trade period I had just
    finished the perusal of his brief notes on Newfoundland; and I earnestly hope
    this admirable pamphlet will receive a wide circulation in Canada, especially
    in commercial circles, for I am not acquainted with any production which can be
    compared with it, in regard to the accuracy and fullness of that information
    regarding the resources, industries and prospects of this country period <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> Paterson has turned his visit to excellent account, and
    has done us a great public service by aiding in dispelling the ignorance which
    still prevails so widely regarding this island period no one can be better
    fitted for such attacks than <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Paterson and the
    statements of the secretary of the Montréal board of trade will carry weight
    with them wherever they are red period in a compact form the pamphlet supplies
    a body of very valuable information, drowned from the most reliable sources
    period I have gone carefully through it, and I believe every statement it
    contains may be thoroughly relied on period if facts and figures cannot
    overcome the rooted incredulity which prevails in the <span class=SpellE>neighbouring</span> provinces regarding the possibility of any good thing coming out of
    Newfoundland, <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Paterson's <span class=SpellE>Rieff</span> notes are to produce a good effect period I trust your commercial men will
    ponder carefully his representations regarding the extension of trade between
    this colony and the Dominion period there can be little doubt that every year
    will witness an increase of our commercial connections with Canada, and it is
    only necessary to direct the attention of the able businessmen of the Dominion
    to the increasing openings for trade prosecuted here, to ensure the direction
    of the enterprise in this direction period the more intercourse founded on mood
    jewel benefit is promoted the more speedily and certainly will knew from land
    be brought to see that her best interest will be promoted by throwing her
    fortunes with the Dominion period multiply? This<span class=GramE>,?</span> Our
    island to the continent by a railroad and steam theory and union will follow as
    a matter of course period the interests of our working classes lie altogether
    in the direction of Confederation, little as at present, the pre-season period
    were we united with Canada, agricultural produce of all kinds and Canadian
    Manufacturer's would be admitted free of duty, thus greatly cheapening the
    expense of living, and at the same time opening an immense field for a Canadian
    products and manufacturers period we must, however, patiently await the
    development of the events and the fermentation of ideas in the public mind
    period political passion, Merrill prejudiced and self interest may prevail for
    a time, but the right will win period meantime I would urge all Canadians to
    read <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Paterson's little pamphlet college by Lovell
    and company if they wish to know what is the present condition of this colony
    period the writer throws out some suggestive hints, which I trust our
    legislators will lay to heart, about the frightful destruction going on in our
    for instance and the utter absence of any proper regulations regarding the
    cutting of timber period it is to be hoped our legislators will see the
    necessity of revisiting existing laws, and throwing open our fine pine forest
    to the lumber under such restrictions as now found to work so well in Canada
    period it is disgraceful to us as a people that matters should be allowed to
    continue as they are for a single day-Art Timber allowed to write or to be
    destroyed by fire, and squatters unlawfully cutting down and carrying off our
    finest pines, in the most wasteful and injurious fashion, and contributing
    nothing to the revenue period by the way, why should not some of the wealthy
    capitalist of Canada investment in our mines period every year proves more and
    more the immense extent of our mineral treasures period we want capital to
    develop these resources period two of the wealthiest capitalist of <span
class=SpellE>Glascow</span> took the bets cold mine, with <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span class=SpellE>ElEllerhausen</span> as managing Partner, about two years
    ago period this year <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> is <span class=SpellE>Dixckson</span> and McKenzie will probably packet each £30,000 currency as they are sure other
    profits of this mine period</p>
  <p>The railway</p>
  <p>Another gentle man who has rendered good service to this
    colony is <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Stanford Fleming period he was the first
    to point out the importance of a railway across the island, from St John's to
    St Georges day, as a means of shortening the route between the two continents;
    and he used his influence in <span class=SpellE>favour</span> of the North
    Shore wrote, by which the integer colonial railway has been brought, at
    Chaleur, to the point nearest Newfoundland, ready at any future time for
    connection with our Island railway period not only soul, but <span
class=SpellE>Mr</span> Fleming has superintended the preliminary survey of our
    railway, free of charge, and secured for us a most satisfactory performance of
    the work, and he is indefatigable in promoting the project by every means in
    his power period before 10 years elapse I venture to predict we shall have this
    railway; and with it a great and prosperous future awaits this one is unknown
    and despised island period</p>
  <p>New geography of Newfoundland</p>
  <p>I venture to call attention to oil geography of Newfoundland
    just published by GF <span class=SpellE>Howley</span> <span class=SpellE>Esq</span> assistant geological survey period it is an excellent compare and, giving fall
    and accurate information regarding the topography, geology, climate, natural
    productions, economics, et cetera of the island period <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> <span class=SpellE>Howley</span> has executed his cash in a most credible
    manner period one good feature in the little volume is a list of indigenous
    animals of the island, about which so little is known period the area of the
    lakes already surveyed is also given and the height et cetera of the principal
    mountains period aided by this and <span class=SpellE>Mr</span> Paterson's
    pamphlet of very fear knowledge of this country might be acquired period the GR
    graffiti paint a small map of the island period the price is only 40% period
    orders can be sent to our principal booksellers here-<span class=SpellE>Mr</span> T <span class=SpellE>Mccomman</span> or Mr. <span class=SpellE>O.f</span>.
    Chisholm period the book is published by the Stanford, London period</p>
  <p>More copper or</p>
  <p>A new discovery of a deposit of copper or is announced at <span
class=SpellE>Harbour</span> Main and Hollywood at the head of conception day
    period it is said that some Nova Scotia and capitalist have entered into an
    arrangement for the working of this mind period it is to be noted that this new
    discovery is not in the region where our present minds are-proving that mineral
    bearing rocks are very widely distributed period</p>
  <p>New? Of heroism</p>
  <p>The readers of the Gazette may remember an account I gave in
    November of last year of the rescue of 12 men from the ship of the wider watch
    at Pooch cold period? <span class=GramE>The heroic efforts of Alfred?</span> <span
class=GramE>Fishermen and a number of his?</span> <span class=GramE>Period in
    the darkness of a winter?</span> And in the midst of a snowstorm, Alfred,
    permitted himself to be swung? Question of a rope over precipice 600 feet? At the
    bottom of which worked well ship wrecked men, clinging to our rock, with the
    sea washing over them period more reach them with a rope and one by one all
    were drawn up and saved period are late <span class=SpellE>Gov</span>, Sir S
    Hill forwarded statement of the gallant question mark of more and his
    companions to the Imperial authorities and the result was that the Royal Humane
    Society have sent out a silver medal for Moors and our bronze medallion for
    each of his companions period Lady Glover very kindly presented the medal's a few
    days ago to the brave men? Especially called for the purpose in the colonial
    building period this graceful and kindly act on the part of her ladyship has
    been very fully appreciated and worthily in our girl raided her residence in
    the colony over whose? Her husband presides period</p>
  <p>Disasters at sea</p>
  <p>We have had some heavy gales of late, resulting in
    considerable loss of life and property period the <span class=SpellE>barque</span> di the <span class=SpellE>Chipman</span>, laden with copper or, from debts cold
    for Swansea, where do sure at witless Bay and became a tall wreck period no
    lives were lost period the kitty Clyde, old by Rogerson &amp;, was last in day
    of Ireland's-all and is saved period several coasting craft, which left before
    the severe deal of the 17th and 18th were not yet accounted for period the
    rescue of the crew of the Daniel a Burn ham by the? Steamer Austrian is one of
    the most remarkable on record period I? The account published in the
    Newfoundlander: one of the most miraculous escapes of which we have any record
    is that of the crew of the American schooner Daniel a Burn ham period business
    Salt was lying off Sable Island when, on Sunday evening the 10th instant, she
    was struck by a heavy sea which completely turned her over period she, however,
    speedily came up on the other side, her mass having given away and the recovery
    was no doubt that are only assisted by the balance being secured in the barn by
    a strong platform, which kept it well in its place period but the remarkable
    part of the story is, that though the vessel was bus rolled over upon the other
    side, not a life of the crew of 13 men was last period all but one were below
    with the time, and they were no doubt saved by the extreme rapidity of the
    movement, which left not time enough for the vessel to steal period they were
    precipitated from the floor to the deck when she was bottom up, and speedily
    again to the floor when she righted period on</p>
