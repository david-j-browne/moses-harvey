	The case of Newfoundland before the Fishery Commission was entrusted to the Hon. W.V. Whiteway, Solicitor-General.  There is but one opinion regarding the industry and ability which he displayed in conducting the case, and the powerful and impressive speech which he delivered after the whole of the evidence was heard.  Mr. Whiteway deserves well of his country in this instance, and has proved himself a skilful advocate and a good patriot.  In the speech referred to there is embodied a mass of very valuable information regarding the extent and value of our great cod fisheries; and I propose to notice a few of the more important points possessing a general interest, which of themselves go far to show the justice and moderation of the late award by the Fishery Commission.

	First of all Mr. Whiteway in his speech points out the extent of the privileges conferred by the Treaty of Washington on the United States, as far as the Newfoundland fisheries are concerned.  Prior to 1871 the United States enjoyed a liberty to fish between Quirpon and Cape Ray, on the west coast, and between Cape Ray and the Rameau Islands on the south coast.  By the Treaty of Washington citizens of the United States acquired the right to take fish of every kind between Rameau Islands and Cape Race, on the south coast, and between Cape Race and the Quirpon Islands on the east coast.  In other words, they were admitted to a participation in a fishery which is one of the most valuable in the world.  In striking contrast to the exhausted cod fisheries of the United States, which are valueless to their own citizens and to us, the Newfoundland fisheries are more productive now than ever they were, and may be described as practically inexhaustible.  Since 1805, when 590 460 quintals of codfish were exported, these fisheries have steadily increased till 1874, when 1 609 724 quintals were exported.  The export of herring has also increased from .... barrels in 1851, to 291 751 barrels in 1876.  Since 1851 the value of our various fish products has doubled, having been $4 456 925 in that year, and $8 511 710 in 1874.  Mr. Whiteway specially impressed on the Commission that "this result is the product of the labours of Newfoundland fishermen, taken wholly from waters within three miles of the shore," because in thhe United States answer and in the arguments of their counsel it was strangely asserted that "cod fishery is a deep sea fishery, and not carried on within territorial waters."  "Add to this then," he said, "the large catch of fish by the French vessels upon the coast, and by the French and United States vessels upon the Banks, the former, according to statistics handed in by Professor Hind, averaging for a period of 8 years, 217 vessels with 8 729 men, the latter forming a very large portion of the entire fishing fleet of the United States, and some approximate idea may be arrived at of the great wealth extracted from the Newfoundland fisheries."  Of the whole fishery, the proportion exclusively taken within the inshore limits thrown open to United States citizens by the Treaty of Washington is valued at $6 000 000 per annum, and is taken by about 15 000 men.  Such, then, is the present value of theses fisheries to which citizens of the United States have obtained access by the Treaty of Washington.

	Not only are the Newfoundland fisheries of immense value at present, but there is all but absolutely certaintly that in the future they will be developed to a far greater extent than at the present time, in as much as they present natural advantages which secure their permanency and increase.  In support of this view, Mr. Whiteway quoted the testimony of Professor Baird, United States Commissioner of Fisheries, who stated "the cod is at the head of fish at the present day.  There is no fish that furnishes food to so many people, the production of which is of so much importance, or which is applied to such a variety of purposes.  The commercial yield is very great, and its capture is the main occupation of a large portion of the inhabitants of the sea coast region of the northern hemisphere."  "The fish generally go off shore during winter, but on the south coast of Newfoundland, they maintain their stay inshore, or else come in in large abundance."  And the Professor referred to the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland as "specially favored localities, as places in shore, where, among others, the largest catches of cod are taken;" and he adds: "it is certainly a notorious fact that herring are much more abundant on the coast of Newfoundland than they are on the coast of the United States."  Mr. Whiteway also quotes from the testimony of Professor Hind before the Commission to the same effect, his opinion concurring with the former in regard to the primary importance of the cod, and to the fact that it always seeks the coldest water whenever ice is not present.  "It is only" says Professor Hind, "where extreme cod water exists that cod is found throughout the year; and upon the American coast it is only where the Arctic current strikes that cod is found throughout the year."  He points out too that there are certain localities where the cod fisheries are inexhaustible, as the Straits of Belle Isle, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, and to use the Professor's own words, "that amazing fishing ground on the south coast of Newfoundland.  There is no portion of the world where there is such an amazing supply of cod.  It has been so for 300 years and upwards. Compared with European fisheries, the Newfoundland and Labrador are far superior in every respect."  Compared with the Norwegian fisheries, including the Lofoden Islands, the Newfoundland fisheries are as five to three, or where five quintals of fish are taken at Newfoundland, three only are taken on the coast of Norway, including the Lofoden Isles.  Professor Hind says, "the bays, and all along the coast of Newfoundland, and also part of the Grand Bank, may be considered as the great spawning grounds of the cod, and the great cod fishery of the world; the conformation of the coast, the depth of water, the deep bays and inlets and the numerous islands surrounding Newfoundland, are peculiarly adapted to constitute that coast as the home of the codfish.  I think there is no part of the world where, owing to the oregraphic features of the coast line, all the conditions of life for the cod are developed to such an extent as the north-east coast of Newfoundland, the northern portion of the Grand Banks, and the southern portion of the island.  Such, then, is the rich heritage to which by treaty we have admitted the citizens of the United States, and it must be evident that we are entitled to a large award in return for such privileges.  As to the fisheries of the United States, they may be reckoned as nil so far as we are concerned; and the admission of our fish to American markets, free of duty, is a small matter, as but a trifling quantity is exported there, and the consumers of that which is sent reap the main benefit.

	In dealing with the important matter of the bait question, Mr. Whiteway proved first of all, from the mouths of witnesses called by the United States, that fresh bait is superior to salt and costs far less money; and that since the Treaty of Washington came into operation, American fishermen have resorted to Newfoundland for supplies of bait, in constantly increasing numbers, until last year, when nearly all the American vessels came to our coasts for bait - a conclusive proof that they find it highly advantageous to do so.  Their catch on the Banks is immensely increased by supplies of fresh bait obtained here, and instead of two trips they are able to make three.  Newfoundland fairly claims a large compensation for such a valuable concession.  But, replied Judge Foster on behalf of the United States, our fishermen do not resort to Newfoundland to take bait, but to buy it.  On this point Mr. Whiteway joined issue with the Judge and proved that, in countless instances, United States fishermen caught the bait themselves on our shores, and also that in other cases, what they called "buying" it was to all intents and purposes a taking it for themselves, within the words of the Treaty.  The practice followed by the United States vessels is, either to hire a Newfoundland fishermen, owner of a seine, who knows the localities of bait, to proceed to the herring ground and secure the necessary quantity of bait for the banker, he being paid a certain sum for the use of his seine and the services of his men; or the vessel goes to the residence of the Newfoundland fishermen and hires men to take the bait and put it on board; or contracts for so much bait and pays according to the quantity.  In all these cases it is really the American masters who catch the bait, just as in a case where one of their vessels hired a crew of Newfoundlanders and took bait in Fortune Bay.  It could not be contended, in the latter case, that because British fishermen, acting under the orders of American masters and paid by them, the bait was not taken by those American masters.  In both cases it is the hired servant acting for others who does the work.  "It would be a subtle distinction," said Mr. Whiteway, "to draw between the man thus hired in Newfoundland, outside of the vessel to catch bait, and the British subject who was hired in Gloucester to proceed to Newfoundland and do the same work.  How very different this contract is from a contract of sale and purchase.  If the herring or other bait had been previously caught, barreled, and in store ready to be sold to the first purchaser who would give him his price, then it would be a simple commercial transaction, but here the article required is a fish freely swimming in the sea. It cannot be taken and held to await a purchaser, but must be taken from the water and immediately put in ice or it is useless.  The American desires to capture it, and whether he captures it through the instrumentality of a British subject or other person, and reduces it into his own possession for his own use, it is immaterial.  The case is one clearly within the maxim of law, "qui facit per alium facit per se."  It is surprising to find men, like Judge Foster, contending on the ground of a subtle and untenable distinction, that for a privilege of such vast consequence to them, and indispensable for the efficient prosecution of the cod fisheries no equivalent whatever should be given.  The decision of the Commission was that the Treaty of Washington conferred no right to purchase bait.  Suppose then that in future no purchase in any shape is allowed.  Americans then must take the bait themselves. Then comes the question what is the assessed value of such a privilege?  The Commission, by their award, showed that they regarded it of very considerable value.  In a future communication I shall probably take up the remaining points of Mr. Whiteway's able speech.  Meantime I must close with a brief notice of current events.
	The three brothers Benoit, accused of the murder of Captain Ridout and his crew, have been discharged, there being no evidence sufficient to warrant the Attorney-General in sending the case before a jury.  Though suspicions were strong enough against the men to warrant their arrest and detention, pending investigation, yet nothing of a tangible nature was elicited, although the Inspector of Police and some of his force spent some time on the western coast in making inquiries and hunting up evidence.  In fact no proof could be obtained that a murder had been committed at all - no remains were discovered, and no proof that the missing men met with foul play.  Rumor has had much to do with the matter.  Under such circumstances there was no other course than the discharge of the prisoners.  Another story is afloat of a murder on Labrador of part of the crew of the Walrus, which left Rigoulette for Montreal October 15th, 1876, and was wrecked near Grady, Andrew Corneaux being the only survivor.  A story in the Harbour Grace Standard, founded on certain rumours, in which the writer attempts to show that the men represented by Corneaux to have been drowned by the upsetting of the boat, were murdered.  Mr. Knight, Collector of Customs, Labrador, has published a letter in which he shows that the tale is utterly incredible and unworthy of attention.  there is a morbid tendency in certain classes of our population, in these distant and lonely settlements, to work up tales of murder and wrecking.  All such stories, after the Ridout case, should be received with caution.

	News has arrived here of the loss near Sydney, C.B., of the Jane Stewart, a fine new vessel, owned by Messrs. Marsh & Sons, of this port.  Sad to relate, Captain Mitchell perished with his vessel.  Fears are entertained for the safety of the barquentine Pearl, out between 40 and 50 days from Bett's Cove, laden with ore for Swansea.

	One hundred men are employed this year at two saw mills on the Gambo.  Lumbering is steadily developing itself here.  The Gander Region, the best in the  island, is still locked up, no lumbering licenses being attainable.

	It is reported that two American steamers are likely to try their fortune next year in our seal fishery.  They will take Newfoundland crews, it is stated.  As yet the matter is only rumored.

	On the 21st of November another Devil-fish, still larger than the one now attracting such crowds in the New York Aquarium, came ashore at Lance Cove, Smith's Sound, Trinity Bay.  The long arms were 33 feet in length and the body 11 feet.  It was left to rot on the beach, the fishermen not being aware of the value of such creatures.  I am in hopes of securing some fragments of it, unless the sea has washed it away.  The Aquarium proprietors paid $500 for the last one and find it a capital investment.
